# 👋 Namaste, I'm Muskaan!

✨ मुस्कान ✨
Finding bugs🪲 so that you don't have to.
✨️ Test Automation Engineer ✨️| b.ignited

I'm a curious and driven problem solver who enjoys building smart, efficient solutions that improve how things work behind the scenes. 💡  
I find real satisfaction in digging into complex issues, streamlining processes, and writing clean, reliable code that makes a difference.

I enjoy working with others and believe some of the best ideas come from collaboration 💙 — but I’m just as comfortable rolling up my sleeves and tackling things on my own.  
I thrive in environments where I’m challenged, surrounded by great people, and always learning something new. 📚

For me, it’s all about learning, growing, and making things better together. ✨🚀
